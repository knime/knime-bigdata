    <shortDescription>Compares two columns by their attribute value pairs.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Compares two columns by their attribute value pairs and shows the 
		    confusion matrix, i.e. how many rows of which attribute and their 
		    classification match.
		    The dialog allows you to select two columns for comparison;
			the values from the first selected column are represented in the 
			confusion matrix's rows and the values from the second column by the
			confusion matrix's columns. The output of the node is the confusion 
			matrix with the number of matches in each cell.
			Additionally, the second out-port reports a number of 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">
			accuracy statistics</a> such as True-Positives, False-Positives, 
			True-Negatives, False-Negatives, Recall, Precision, Sensitivity, 
			Specificity, F-measure, as well as the overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa.

        <option name="First column">The first column represents the real classes of the data.</option>
        <option name="Second column">The second column represents the predicted classes of the data.</option>
        <option name="Sorting strategy">Whether to sort the labels lexically or numerically.</option>
        <option name="Reverse order">Reverse the order of the elements.</option>
        <option name="Use name prefix">The scores (i.e. accuracy, error rate, number of correct and wrong classification) are exported
        as flow variables with a hard coded name. This option allows you to define a prefix for these variable identifiers so that name
        conflicts are resolved.</option>
