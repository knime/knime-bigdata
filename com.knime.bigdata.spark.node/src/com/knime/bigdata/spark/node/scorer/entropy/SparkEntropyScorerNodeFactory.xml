			Scorer for clustering results given a reference clustering.
			Connect the Spark RDD containing a column with the reference cluster IDs
			as well as a column containing the clustering results to
			the input port. The respective columns can be selected in the dialog.
			After successful execution, the view will show entropy values (the smaller the better) and a
			quality value (in [0,1] - with 1 being the best possible
			value, as used in

		This option allows you to define a prefix for these variable identifiers so that name conflicts are resolved.

		<inPort index="0" name="Spark RDD">
			Arbitrary input Spark RDD with at least two columns, where one column contains the reference clustering
			and one the clustering that shall be scored.
		</inPort>
		<outPort index="0" name="Quality Table">
			Table containing entropy values for each cluster. The last row
			contains statistics on the entire clustering. It corresponds to
			the table shown in the Statistics View.

	<views>
		<view index="0" name="Statistics View">
			Simple statistics on the clustering such as number of
			clusters being found, number of objects in clusters, number
			of reference clusters, and total number of objects. Further
			statistics include:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Entropy: The accumulated entropy of all identified
					clusters, weighted by the relative cluster size. The
					entropy is not normalized and may be greater than 1.
				</li>
				<li>
					Quality: The quality value according to the formula
					referenced above. It is the sum of the weighted
					qualities of the individual clusters, whereby the
					quality of a single cluster is calculated as (1 -
					normalized_entropy). The domain of the quality value
					is [0,1].
				</li>
			</ul>
			The table at the bottom of the view provides statistics on
			<i>cluster size</i>, <i>cluster entropy</i>, 
			<i>normalized cluster entropy</i> and <i>quality</i>. The
			<i>entropy</i> of a clusters is based on the reference clustering (provided
			at the first input port) and the <i>normalized entropy</i>
			is this value scaled to an interval [0, 1]. More precisely,
			it is the entropy divided by log2(number of different
			clusters in the reference set). The quality value is only available
			in the last row (showing the overall statistics).
