        Writes KNIME Table into a ORC File
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node writes the KNIME data table into an ORC file. The ORC file can be written locally or on a remote file system.
        <p>
        For remote connections, the writer stores chunks locally and uploads them in parallel into a folder with the given name.
        The chunks size and the number of chunks that are allowed on local disc, are configurable in the "Chunk Upload" 
        tab which is only enabled for remote file systems.

            <option name="Write to">
                Select a file system in which you want to store the file. There
                are
                four default file system options to choose from:
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>Local File System:</i>
                        Allows you to select a location in your
                        local system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Mountpoint:</i>
                        Allows you to write to a mountpoint.
                        When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
                        Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected
                        (note that browsing is disabled in this case).
                        Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable
                        browsing.
                        A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but
                        is
                        no longer available.
                        You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a
                        valid i.e. known mountpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Relative to:</i>
                        Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
                        relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current
                        workflow's data area.
                        When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the
                        three
                        options to use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i>
                        Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime://
                        protocol).
                        When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the
                        desired
                        connection and write timeout in milliseconds.
                        In case it takes longer to connect to the host / write the file, the
                        node fails to execute.
                        Browsing is disabled for this option.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
                you have to enable the file system connection input port of this
                node
                by clicking the
                <b>...</b>
                in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
                <i>Add File System Connection port</i>
                .
                <br />
                Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to
                this
                node.
                The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
                It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you
                have to (re)execute the connector node first.
                Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file
                system is provided via the input port.
            </option>
            <option name="File/URL">
                Enter a URL when writing to
                <i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>,
                otherwise enter a path to a file. The
                required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as
                &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
                File System on Windows) or &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
                File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected
                via
                input port, the node
                description of the respective connector node describes the required path
                format.
                You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down
                list, or select a location
                from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
                Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i>
                        Browsing is always disabled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Mountpoint:</i>
                        Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
                        Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable
                        browsing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
                        Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed
                        since the workflow has been opened.
                        (Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </option>
            <option name="Create missing folders">Select if the folders of the selected
                output location should be created if they do not already exist. If this
                option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not exist.
            </option>
            <option name="File Compression">
                The compression codec used to write the ORC file.

            <option name="Split data into files of size (rows)">
                Splits up the input data into files with at most the given number of data rows.
                This option is only available if the folder mode is selected.
            </option>
            <option name="File name prefix">
                The prefix to use for the file within the selected folder. A running index is appended starting with 0 
                e.g. part_00000.orc, part_00001.orc. This option is only available if the folder mode is selected.
            </option>
            <option name="Within file stripe size (rows)">
                Defines the maximum number of rows of a file stripe. For more details see the
