	<name>Parquet Writer</name>

	<shortDescription>
        Writes KNIME tables into a Parquet File
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node writes the KNIME data table into a Parquet file. The
			Parquet file can be written locally or on a remote file system.
			<p>
				For remote connections, the writer stores chunks locally and uploads
				them in parallel into a folder with the given name.
				The chunks size and the number of chunks that are allowed on local
				disc, are configurable in the "Chunk Upload"
				tab which is only enabled for remote file systems.
			</p>

		<tab name="Settings">
			<description>
				General settings regarding the output file location and storage configuration.
			</description>
			<option name="Write to">
				Select a file system in which you want to store the file. There
				are
				four default file system options to choose from:
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Local File System:</i>
						Allows you to select a location in your
						local system.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Mountpoint:</i>
						Allows you to write to a mountpoint.
						When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
						Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected
						(note that browsing is disabled in this case).
						Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable
						browsing.
						A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but
						is
						no longer available.
						You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a
						valid i.e. known mountpoint.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Relative to:</i>
						Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
						relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current
						workflow's data area.
						When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the
						three
						options to use.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i>
						Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime://
						protocol).
						When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the
						desired
						connection and write timeout in milliseconds.
						In case it takes longer to connect to the host / write the file, the
						node fails to execute.
						Browsing is disabled for this option.
					</li>
				</ul>
				It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
				you have to enable the file system connection input port of this
				node
				by clicking the
				<b>...</b>
				in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
				<i>Add File System Connection port</i>
				.
				<br />
				Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to
				this
				node.
				The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
				It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you
				have to (re)execute the connector node first.
				Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file
				system is provided via the input port.
			</option>
			<option name="File/URL">
				Enter a URL when writing to
				<i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>,
				otherwise enter a path to a file. The
				required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as
				&quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
				File System on Windows) or &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
				File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected
				via
				input port, the node
				description of the respective connector node describes the required path
				format.
				You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down
				list, or select a location
				from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
				Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i>
						Browsing is always disabled.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Mountpoint:</i>
						Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
						Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable
						browsing.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
						Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed
						since the workflow has been opened.
						(Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			<option name="Create missing folders">Select if the folders of the selected
				output location should be created if they do not already exist. If this
				option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not exist.
			</option>
			<option name="If exists">
				Specify the behavior of the node in case the output file already
				exists.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Overwrite:</i>
						Will replace any existing file.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Fail:</i>
						Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent
						unintentional overwrite).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			<option name="File Compression">
			    The compression codec used to write the Parquet file.
			</option>
			<option name="Split data into files of size (MB)">
			    Splits up the input data into files of the specified maximum size in megabytes.
				This option is only available if the folder mode is selected.
			</option>
            <option name="File name prefix">
                The prefix to use for the file within the selected folder. A running index is appended starting with 0 
                e.g. part_00000.parquet, part_00001.parquet. This option is only available if the folder mode is selected.
            </option>
            <option name="Within file row group size (MB)">
                Defines the maximum size of a row group within a file in megabyte. For more details see the
                <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/documentation/latest/">Parquet documentation</a>.
            </option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Type Mapping">
			<description>
				Change the KNIME to Parquet type mapping configuration
				for subsequent nodes by selecting a Parquet type to the given
				KNIME Type.
				The dialog allows you to add new or change existing type mapping rules.
			</description>
			<option name="Mapping by Name">
				Columns that match the given name (or regular expression) and KNIME type
				will be mapped
				to the specified Parquet type.
			</option>
			<option name="Mapping by Type">
				Columns that match the given KNIME type will be mapped to the specified
				Parquet type.
