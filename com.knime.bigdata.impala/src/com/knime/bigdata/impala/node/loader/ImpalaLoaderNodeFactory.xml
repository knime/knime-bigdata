    <name>Impala Loader</name>
    <shortDescription>Loads data from KNIME into Impala</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node loads a KNIME data table into Impala. Impala requires imported data to be present in the 
            HDFS file system on the Impala server, therefore this node first copies the data onto the Impala server. 
            You can use the HDFS Connection node to establish a connection to the HDFS file system. 
            The data is then loaded into a Impala table and the uploaded file is deleted.
            <br />
            Additionally the data can be partitioned by selecting one or more compatible columns (e.g. integer or
            string). The node relies on Impala's dynamic partitioning.
        </intro>

        <option name="Target folder">
            A folder on the server where the temporary copy of the data is copied. The Impala server user
            needs read and write access to this folder.
        </option>
        <option name="Table name">
            The name of the new table in the database.
        </option>
        <option name="Drop existing table">
            If this option is selected, an existing table will be dropped and re-created. Otherwise the
            table is loaded into the existing table. Note that the import may fail in this case if the table structure
            and partitioning information do not match.
        </option>
        <option name="Partition columns">
            Here you can select one or more columns that should be used for partitioning the data in the
            table. A partitioned table requires a two-step import via a temporary table and therefore is much slower 
            than import into an unpartitioned table.
